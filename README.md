# AdventureWorks-Data-Analysis-with-Power-BI

## Project Overview
The objective was to provide business intelligence solutions for AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company producing cycling equipment and accessories. The management team required insights on sales, revenue, profit, returns, regional performance, and product-level trends to make informed business decisions.

## Situation
AdventureWorks provided raw CSV files containing information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories. My task was to transform this raw data into actionable insights by building an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

## Objectives
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns.
- Compare performance across different regions.
- Analyze product-level trends to identify high-performing products.
- Highlight high-value customers and customer trends.

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Data Source:** CSV files provided by AdventureWorks
- **Techniques:**
  - Data Import and Transformation using Power BI Query Editor
  - Building a Relational Data Model
  - DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for Calculated Columns and Measures
  - Designing Dashboards with Interactive Visualizations

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Connection and Transformation:** Imported the raw CSV files, cleaned the data, and formatted it for analysis.
2. **Relational Data Model:** Established relationships between tables (e.g., sales, customers, products) to support complex queries and aggregations.
3. **Calculated Columns & Measures:** Created custom measures and columns using DAX for KPIs such as total sales, profit margins, and product return rates.
4. **Interactive Dashboard Design:**
   - Built a series of visuals including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to track sales trends, product performance, and customer insights.
   - Included slicers and filters to allow users to interact with the data, drilling down by region, product, or time period.

## Key Visualizations & Insights
- **Sales Performance by Region:** Bar chart comparing revenue across sales territories.
- **Product-Level Analysis:** Product performance trends highlighted top-selling and most profitable items.
- **Customer Insights:** Identified high-value customers through sales trends and purchasing behavior.
- **Returns Analysis:** Tracked product returns and their impact on overall profitability.

## Conclusion
This Power BI project helped AdventureWorks identify key business trends, which can now guide decision-making related to sales strategies, customer segmentation, and product development.
